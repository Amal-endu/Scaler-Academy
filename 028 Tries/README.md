First refer Binary tree implementation using 2d array, likewise, we're going to use this 2d matrix to represent nodes in trie to save memory and avoid MLE (Memory Overflow Error)
By implementing trie in such manner helps you to process the trie earlier and also the dynamic allocation is too slow to process.
